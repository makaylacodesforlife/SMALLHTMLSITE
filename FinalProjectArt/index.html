      <p> Welcome ! This is my new website garnered towards selling paintings! My friend knows someone that may want to sell their paintings so I may improve this website slowly over time for them!</p>
      <br>
      <p> This semester has been pretty good and I am looking forward to next semester. One reason I chose this program is because it is completely online</p>
      <br>
      <p> This semester I also did a code bootcamp that was completely online and my work is completely online too.</p>
      <p>I hope that I will one day have a job as a UI/UX designer</p>
